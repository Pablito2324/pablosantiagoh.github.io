  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Electronic Engineer with a strong practical focus on embedded systems, automation,
    and applied electronics. I have experience working in real operational environments,
    integrating electronic systems, and solving technical problems under real-world
    constraints.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am known for being approachable and collaborative, maintaining a positive attitude
    while remaining professional and focused when required. I enjoy learning continuously,
    taking ownership of my work, and contributing actively to team-based projects.

  <h2>How I Work</h2>

  <p>
    I approach projects with a strong sense of ownership and responsibility.
    I like to clearly understand the problem before proposing solutions,
    focusing on reliability, simplicity, and real-world constraints.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy working in collaborative environments and communicating clearly
    with both technical and non-technical team members. I am approachable and
    positive, while remaining focused and professional when precision and
    discipline are required.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am highly committed to continuous learning and improvement, especially
    in areas related to electronics, automation, and embedded systems. I value
    feedback, adaptability, and delivering solutions that work reliably in
    real operational conditions.
